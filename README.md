# zerk-dash-cancle

A recent test has proved that zerk is underpowered, so they will be given a buff to fix this. 
- Cyclone now has 50% chance to proc Flurry I when charged.
- When dash is used, Dash will not be used until Flurry is activate.

Okok on serious note: This requires flurry glyph on dash. Have fun <3
